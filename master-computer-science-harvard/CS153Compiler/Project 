• A conditional control statement (e.g., IF).
• A looping control statement.
• Procedures or functions with calls and returns.
• Parameters passed by value or by reference.
• Basic error recovery (skip to semicolon or end of line).
• Nontrivial sample programs written in the source language.
• Generate Jasmin assembly code that can be successfully assembled.
• Execute the resulting .class file.
• No crashes (e.g., null pointer exceptions).
