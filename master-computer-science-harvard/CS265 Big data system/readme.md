Big data is everywhere. A fundamental goal across numerous modern businesses and sciences is to be able to exploit as many machines as possible, to consume as much information as possible and as fast as possible. The big challenge is "how to turn data into useful knowledge". This is a moving target as both the underlying hardware and our ability to collect data evolve. In this class, we will discuss how to design data systems and algorithms for key data-driven areas, including relational systems, distributed systems, graph systems, noSQL, newSQL, machine learning and neural networks. We will see how they all rely on the same set of very basic concepts and we will learn how to synthesize efficient solutions for any problem across these areas using those basic concepts.

In each class we will read one recent research paper and the instructor will lead a discussion around the technical aspects of the work but crucially also on how the fundamental concepts of this work connect with other fields, applications and problems. Students will write two reviews (summary, critique, ideas) per week on the assigned papers for discussion. Each student is expected to present at least once during the semester: each class starts with a short presentation by a student for the paper of the day. In addition, each student will participate in a semester long project (systems or research project). Research projects are integrated with the work at DASlab and are meant to lead to a research publication within the next 1-2 years.

Central Learning Outcomes: Understanding fundamental concepts in data storage and access; Learning to read and quickly understand research papers; Learning to prepare and deliver clear presentations on complex topics; Getting a feeling on what it means to do research.
