2Problem 1You need a new staff assistant,  and you havenpeople to interview.  You want to hire the bestcandidate for the position.  When you interview a candidate, you can give them a score, with thehighest score being the best and no ties being possible.  You interview the candidates one by one.Because of your company’s hiring practices, after you interview thek-th candidate, you either offerthe candidate the job before the next interview, or you lose the chance to ever hire that candidate.We suppose the candidates are interviewed in a random order, chosen uniformly at random fromalln! possible orderings.We consider the following strategy:  first, interviewmcandidates, but reject them all.  Thesecandidates give you an idea of how strong the candidates are.  After them-th candidate, hire thefirst candidate you interview who is better than all of the previous candidates you have interviewed.1.  LetEbe the even that we hire the best available assistant, and letEibe the event thati-thcandidate is the best and is hired.  Determine Pr(Ei), and show thatPr(E) =mnn∑j=m+11j−1.2.  Bound∑nj=m+11j−1to obtainmn(lnn−lnm)≤Pr(E)≤mn(ln(n−1)−ln(m−1)).3.  Show  thatm(lnn−lnm)/nis  maximized  whenm=n/e,  and  explain  why  this  meansPr(E)≥1/e if we choose the optimal strategy.
