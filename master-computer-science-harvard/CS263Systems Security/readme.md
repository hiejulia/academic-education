Course: CS 263: Systems Security

Course Level: Graduate

While this is a graduate-level course, most of the students that take it are undergraduates. The material in this module is pitched at the advanced undergraduate level.

Course Description: "This course explores practical attacks on modern computer systems, explaining how those attacks can be mitigated using careful system design and the judicious application of cryptography. The course discusses topics like buffer overflows, web security, information flow control, and anonymous communication mechanisms like Tor. The course includes several small projects which give students hands-on experience with various offensive and defensive techniques; the final, larger project is open-ended and driven by student interests."

odule Goals:

Familiarize students with contemporary debates about whether corporations should be allowed to “hack back” in response to cyberattacks.
Teach students to ethically evaluate possible courses of action that cybersecurity professionals might take in response to a cyberattack (including hacking back) by considering how available responses might affect the rights and interests of different groups of stakeholders.
Help students to understand that, in many cases, determining which possible response(s) to a cyberattack would be ethically acceptable requires determining how competing rights and interests ought to be balanced.
Introduce students to philosophical arguments that take different stances on whether hacking back (in general) strikes an ethically acceptable balance among competing rights and interests.
Help students critically evaluate these arguments by considering whether they yield plausible results when applied to realistic case studies.
Key Philosophical Questions:

Under what conditions, if any, is it morally permissible (or, less technically, ethically acceptable) for cybersecurity professionals to hack back on behalf of the corporations they work for?
How might the decision to hack back (or not) affect the moral rights and morally significant interests of different groups of stakeholders?
In cases where stakeholder rights and interests conflict, how should cybersecurity professionals decide how to balance those competing rights and interests in responding to an attack?
Why do many commentators believe that hacking back is not just morally wrong, but obviously morally wrong? (Are they right?)
Why do some commentators reject this orthodox position, claiming that hacking back is not only morally permissible, but should in fact be encouraged?
How should cybersecurity professionals respond in cases where there is uncertainty concerning who is responsible for an attack?
Is hacking back a form of vigilantism, self-defense, or neither? How should our answer to this question affect our views about the moral permissibility of hacking back?
Many people believe that it is morally permissible for the government to quarantine individuals infected with highly contagious, life-threatening diseases without their consent. Is it, similarly, morally permissible for companies to hack into “infected” third-party machines controlled by cybercriminals, provided that doing so is necessary to prevent those machines from being used in potentially devastating cyberattacks?


Class Agenda:

Overview.
What is hacking back?
Case study: Facebook and the Koobface gang.
Case study analysis: identifying potential effects on stakeholder rights and interests.
Arguments that appeal to the benefits of hacking back.
Arguments that appeal to the costs of hacking back.
Adjudicating conflicting rights and interests: Patrick Lin’s “Argument from Self-Defense” and “Argument from Public Health.”
