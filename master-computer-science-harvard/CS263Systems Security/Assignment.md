# Facebook security team 
Sample Class Activity: The central case study for this module is the Facebook security team’s 2011 response to ongoing cyberattacks on its systems and users perpetrated by the so-called “Koobface Gang,” a group of cybercriminals operating out of St. Petersburg, Russia. After explaining the nature of these cyberattacks and the offensive actions taken by Facebook’s security team in response, the Embedded EthiCS TA leads students through a discussion of how the decision to hack back in similar cases might affect the rights and interests of various stakeholder groups. Groups discussed include the company being attacked (in this case, Facebook), the company’s userbase (Facebook users), third parties not involved in the attack who might be inadvertently affected by an offensive response against the alleged attackers, and other members of the public.



Case study: Facebook and the Koobface gang.
Case study analysis: identifying potential effects on stakeholder rights and interests.
