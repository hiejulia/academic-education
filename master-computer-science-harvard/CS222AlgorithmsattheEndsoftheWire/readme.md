# Course syllabus 
Objectives
This course is loosely based on the theme of how to deal with really big data, especially over networks. The topics change from year to year, and the below is subject to change. The course will consist of multiple independent units, covering the major themes of information retrieval (search engines), compression, data summarization algorithms, and coding theory. Although the course will emphasize theoretical foundations, it will definitely be a mix of both theory and practice, and current issues will also be emphasized. The course is meant to show the synthesis of theory and practice; we will often read pairs of papers, one from the "theory community" and one from the "systems community", on the same theme. The course is also meant to promote skills required of graduate students, such as criticial and creative reading and analysis of papers, and research.

The main work of the course will consist of the following: reading and analyzing a number of current and classic research papers; homework assignments based on the material; participating in a mock program committee; and undertaking a final research project. (I have been told the workload of the class is reasonable but non-trivial. If you were looking for a graduate class with no work requirements, please look elsewhere.)

During the semester, you will frequently be reading essentially 2 research papers to prepare for each class. This is more work than it sounds like! You must come to class prepared consistently; if your schedule will not permit that, you should not take the class.

There will be 3 or 4 short homework assignments; I expect to have one for each unit. These are described more below.

The other major work this year is that we will run a "mock program committee". I will choose papers from recent conferences (so ostensibly the are already good) thematically related to the course, and the class will act as a program committee to choose the best ones. This will give you an idea of how program committees work (or don't), and let you see some more up-to-date research, as class reading will be more focused on "classics". This is a fairly experimental approach; I have only done it once. However, it seemed useful for gaining an understanding how program committees function, which seems helpful to graduate students.

Finally, a major component of the class will be a final project, which you will work on for approximately the last 2 months of the course. The hope is that this project may form the foundation of either a research paper or, for undergraduates, a senior thesis. (Last time I taught the course, three projects, with substantially more work, became research papers. Expectations, however, are realistic; research is exploration, and this project is understood to be the beginning, not necessarily the end, of such an exploration.) Although you will need to obtain approval for your project choice, the topic of the final project will primarily be up to you. This project can either be theoretical or implementation based in nature. Generally people work in pairs for the final project, but this is not required. For graduate students, your project can be related to your main line of research; it should not, however, be something you were already working on.
