# Course syllabus

Reading
The required textbook for the course is Introduction to the Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser (2nd edition). (The 3rd edition can also be used, though page numbers will differ.) Every lecture will have assigned reading, which you are expected to do before coming to class. We will set up a mechanism for you to provide feedback on the reading before class, so that lecture can focus on the difficult points. The author has maintained a list of errata at http://math.mit.edu/~sipser/book.html, which you are encouraged to enter into your book right away to avoid future confusions.

For more mathematical background (in addition to Chapter 0 in Sipser), we recommend the materials from CS20, and/or the books How to Do Proofs by Solow, and Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by Rosen. Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness by Garey and Johnson is recommended for "culture" and as a good reference for practicing computer scientists.

Homework Assignments
There will be weekly problem sets. CS121 homeworks will generally due on Tuesdays at 11:59pm sharp. There will be a 20% lateness penalty for CS121 homeworks turned in by Friday at 11:59pm sharp; no credit will be given for homework turned in after 11:59 Friday. CSCI E-207 problem sets are generally due Fridays at 11:59pm, with no late problem sets accepted.

Each CS121 homework assignment has 2-3 “parts”, to be turned in electronically as separate documents. The parts, but not individual problems, can be turned in “late” or “on time” separately. CSCI E-207 problem sets are not divided into "parts." Homeworks will be graded both for correctness and for clarity; graders are not required to guess the intended meaning of poorly written answers.

It is strongly recommended that students learn the LaTeX document processing system and use it when preparing their solutions. It is the standard text processing tool of mathematical scientists everywhere, and it is free and noncommercial.

The first problem set (PS0) doesn't count, but it will be graded and returned as though it did. Its purpose is to review essential mathematical background and to get everyone used to the document preparation and submission procedures and to the style in which the rest of the problem sets will be graded.
