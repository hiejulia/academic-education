# Course syllabus :
At Harvard this is seminar course 
Seminar course exploring recent research in computer architecture. Topics vary from year to year and will include subjects such as multi-core architectures, energy-efficient computing, reliable computing, and the interactions of these issues with system software. Students read and present research papers, undertake a research project.
