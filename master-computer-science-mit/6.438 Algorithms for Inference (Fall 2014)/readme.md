This is a graduate-level introduction to the principles of statistical inference with probabilistic models defined using graphical representations. The material in this course constitutes a common foundation for work in machine learning, signal processing, artificial intelligence, computer vision, control, and communication. Moreover, it is the companion course to 6.437 (Inference and Information) which is offered each Spring; 6.437 and 6.438 may be taken in either order.

It is worth stressing that 6.438 Algorithms for Inference is an introductory graduate subject: it is not an advanced graduate subject for students who have already have a mastery of statistical inference algorithms, yet want to understand such material at an even more sophisticated level. That said, the structure of this subject will be somewhat different than other such introductions to the topic.

Ultimately, the subject is about teaching you contemporary approaches to, and perspectives on, problems of statistical inference. The development of the material that forms the basis for this subject has historically been very much driven by applications. However, our focus in the course will not be on these applications, which form the basis for entire courses of their own, but rather on the common problem solving frameworks that they share. Nevertheless, we will cite various relevant applications as we develop the material and sometimes extract simplified examples from these contexts.
